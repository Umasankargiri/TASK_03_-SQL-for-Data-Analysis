# TASK_03_-SQL-for-Data-Analysis
SQL-based analysis of an online food delivery system. Includes structured queries, joins, subqueries, views, and indexing to extract business insights from a relational database.

# 🧾 Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis – Online Food Delivery Project

## 📌 Objective
To analyze structured data from an online food delivery system using SQL. This task demonstrates the ability to extract insights, join relational tables, apply aggregate functions, and optimize queries for performance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench for query execution and database management
- Online Food Delivery Dataset (custom schema with 5 relational tables)
- Screenshots captured for query outputs
- SQL file with documented queries and logic

## 🗃️ Dataset Overview
The project uses a realistic food delivery schema with the following tables:
- `orders`: Order details including customer and restaurant IDs
- `order_details`: Items per order with quantity
- `menu_item`: Food items with price and restaurant linkage
- `restaurant`: Restaurant metadata including city and registration date
- `customers`: Customer profiles with city and signup date

## 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Applied
| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY | Basic filtering and aggregation |
| JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT) | Combining data across multiple tables |
| Subqueries | Identifying above-average customers |
| Aggregate Functions | Calculating total revenue, average price |
| Views | Monthly revenue tracking |
| Indexes | Performance optimization on key columns |

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Top 5 customers by order frequency
- Most popular food items by city
- Total revenue generated by each restaurant
- Customers who order more than the average
- Monthly revenue trends across the platform

## 📁 Deliverables
- `task4_queries.sql`: All queries with comments and structure
- Screenshots of query outputs
- README documentation (this file)

## 🎯 Outcome
This task strengthened my SQL skills in:
- Query structuring and debugging
- Business-focused data analysis
- Preparing clean, professional documentation for recruiters
